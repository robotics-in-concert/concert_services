# This needs some work - we need to actually pass in more variables
# than just the names, see launch/turtle.launch for possible args.

# Currently:
#    <arg name="turtle_name"              default="turtle"/>
#    <arg name="turtle_rapp_whitelist"    default="[]"/>
#    <arg name="turtle_concert_whitelist" default=""/>
